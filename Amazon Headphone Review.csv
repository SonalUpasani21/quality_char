"My second time buying this headset, first time was 2018 and they held on for 7 years of daily use.
Decided to replace them after the earpads started peeling and the cord had some wear and tear that made me nervous, but otherwise they still worked fine.
Honestly the best headset I've ever purchased.",5
"I bought this headset for my PS5 and really liked the build quality and the sound quality. I was not able to test the microphone with the chat. Unfortunately, I have to return it because the shape of the earbuds is not good for my ears and it is becoming uncomfortable. Without this detail, I kept it without hesitation because it is the best, most immersive and rich sound that I have tested so far. Too bad.
I recommend it because if it does you, you will have something very good.",4
"I am not impressed by the sound quality or the microphone. The headset hurts my head/hair, even though I do not have a big one. This might be subjective, but it is helpful to know.
Overall, overrated, overpriced.",3
I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas because of the great reviews. Who in the world would make headphones that aren't adjustable at all? They barely fit on his head- the ear cups are way too high up and there's no ability to move them down because of the permanent position of the elastic band. The microphone quality also sucks compared to his previous headsets when this was meant to be an upgrade. There's a lot of echo and they pick up so much background noise. Will likely be requesting a refund and returning these for something better.,1
Not 7.1 but better than some,5
"The floating headband is weird to get used to, I keep trying to adjust the headset itself for my head but you can’t do that lol, I get headset fatigue pretty quickly with this headset for some reason, and idk if it’s just user error or what but when I plug it in to charge, it turns on even if I had it off beforehand, mic quality is great though!",4
Mic Is go's.,5
"Bluetooth earbuds that are reliable, no disconnections and easy to use with my Mac mini. The earbuds are comfortable despite the time used. I am satisfied with this model the voice is clear in short I recommend this product!",5
"Stopped working about 1.5-2 months later, dungle would not work after several times reconnecting it, mic would randomly stop working, now stopped working completely.
Complete waste of money, better off with corsair void pro/elite.",1
It is the second set of Corsair wired headset I owned. I find the shape and fabric of the earpads to be the most comfortable for all day use. Recently I thought the microphone stopped working but it seems to be a compatability issue with either windows or HP software. I just plug in through a hub and I have my comfort and sound back.,5
satisfied,5
"This is the third wireless headset I've tried and by far the best one, it has a dedicated usb fob connection so don't notice any delay in the audio and microphone.

Microphone:
Speaking of microphone, probably the best wireless microphone that I've tried on a wireless headset at this price range. Crisp sounding audio and using NVIDIA broadcast you can cut out a long of background noise if that's something that concerns you.

Comfortability:
The actual headset sits comfy, with an adjustable strap that you can change to fit to your head size (I have a pretty big head and big ears and it sits well, and covers my ears with no issues). The memory foam pads fit well onto your head and doesn't hurt even if you have glasses like me, I've worn these for 8+ hours on games and the only time I notice it is when I move my head too fast and feel the strap on my head a little.

Audio:
The audio is pretty good, it comes with Dolby Atmos but even using iCUE defaults it's pretty good. I switch between the normal, FPS, and bass boosted depending on what I'm doing and it's a good mix. You can also hit volume slider on the side of your headset to switch through them without having to open iCUE.

Battery Life:
The battery life of 20 hours is on the lower end of these headsets, but I've never actually had to use it for 20 hours without stopping at once, and it charges pretty fast while I'm cooking or going out for a bit. If your headset does end up dying, you can use this headset just plugged into your computer with the included USB cable.

Overall this is one of the best headsets at this price range, especially if you're looking for a headset to game and stream/talk in-game. No complaints from me :D",5
"L headset, cheap feeling & uncomfortable, buy astros instead",1
no adjustment to the head,2
"This is my 4th Corsair product and again, I have problems with it except that it started from the first days. The battery life of 20 hours is completely up to scratch, after 2 days of use, the headphones sound after 5 hours to be recharged.

The headphones are too small for a person with a big head, and yet I don't think I have a particularly big head, but the underside of the headphones raises my earlobes because the adjustment is almost zero. It also makes my head hurt a lot because for the headphones to be in place, I have to force a little to make them go down which makes the arch of the helmet press strongly on the top of my skull.

In short, it starts again tomorrow. Next.",1
"Nice product,I ordered a second one and they haven't shipped it yet,wats going on.i have prime ordered prime day still haven't shipped.",5
Very good sound... Good microphone... Extra durability... I have had my h80 for 3 years. since it came out it still works like new.,5
"For anyone who is struggling to remove the ear pads/cups when trying to submit a warranty claim or find the product number, I suggest searching on Youtube for a quick video. If you don't have time for that here is how it is done:

-Hold the headset with the microphone piece on the left side.
-Position your right hand to grab the entire LEFT ear pad as if you are covering it with your hand. Grab on tight to the entire thing, so that your fingers are holding a thin plastic edge around the foam. Do NOT grab the foam directly.
-Twist in a counter-clockwise motion (towards you). Note that it may feel like nothing is happening however you have to unlock the ear pad which requires a twisting motion.
-Once you feel the ear pad has turned towards you ('unlocked') simply pull it away from the headset.
-Do the exact same thing for the RIGHT ear pad however use your left hand. You should still be twisting towards you (but this time it will be a clockwise motion).

ACTUAL REVIEW
Positives:
I really like this headset. It is comfortable, seems to have good build quality (**except for the ear pads**) and I have never had an issue with the battery. I use it on my PC and I always use it wirelessly with no issues. I plug it into charge when I am not using it and so far so good. I also like that it has a scroll wheel to change the audio volume instead of having to do it through my computer. The mic seems to be great and I've never noticed any audio issues when recording myself. In addition, the regular headset speakers/audio aspect seems pretty good to me and everything has sounded clear. Honestly I have no complaints from an audio or quality perspective except for the ear pads (see below).

Negatives:
One small negative to get out of the way early is that while I appreciate that there is an audio volume scroll wheel built into the headset, having a way to 'pause' audio would have been even better. I've had previous headsets with this functionality and I loved it and so I do miss it with the HS80.
The biggest negative by far is that the foam ear pads appear to have a known issue with build quality as many people experience an issue where the fabric that covers the foam rips/falls off. I experienced this issue a few months after purchasing the headset and it was annoying because it only happened on one side, and the rest of the headset was perfectly fine. I ended up creating a ticket with support and getting it replaced, but that required setting my old 'faulty' headset in and waiting for a replacement. It was also very confusing on how to get the parts and product number needed for the warranty claim because the instructions to get these numbers was not clear. You have to take the ear pads off the headset and the numbers are on stickers underneath, but when the ear pads are already falling apart, the last thing we should be doing is handling them and trying to twist them off which can require a lot of force the first time. About a year after I received the replacement headset one of the ear cups started to break again. I once again went through the struggle to try and get the ear pad off and I ended up making the initial issue many times worse. I was pretty annoyed and didn't want to bother with the whole warranty replacement process AGAIN so I ended up buying third-party ear pads. Turns out they are also super comfortable and appear to have great build quality so I can now enjoy the headset without worrying about the day when the OEM foam ear pads would start falling off.

Overall great headset, just fix the build quality with the ear pads and they would be 5 stars. Or at least change the warranty process to just send over replacement ear pads instead of replacing the entire headset which wastes a lot of time and probably money.",3
Always loved the headset Perfect and comfy,5
"I was using a Hyper X cloud before this and man, what a difference in sound quality. These things are great for gaming and have a long battery life to boast.",5
"As I said I got these after the V’s. I originally loved those for like 2-3 years but as time went on they were too heavy for my head and gave me migraines, the pleather on them quickly wears down -but- the sound quality was top notch. I bought these because a friend put me on the headset strap design, he has the steel series of similar value. I tried them but I hated the sound in comparison. Tried my GFs razor kraken ( the kitty ear ones of course) to see if I like razors sound profile. Way too much bass.

But these
Same great sound quality as my Vs with a little more bass but only enough to make the sound feel fuller. I play tarkov/squad/war thunder/ and other games where sound plays a key role in the game hence why I was picky but these are like the Porsche Caymen if the V’s were the Porsche 911. Same great unmaskable quality and feel. The thing you miss out on and where the extra money goes to with the V’s is the things that come with it and the bodies construction imo

The HS80’s arent completely metal like the V’s and don’t come with a cross stitched magnetic bag to carry them in but they’re hands down the my favourite headset I’ve tried.

I’ve tried
Virtuoso’s (8.5/10)
Razor kraken kitty ear (6.5/10)
Razor black shark V2 (7.5/10)
Steel series arctic nova pro’s (7.5/10)
JBL Quantum 910’s (6.5/10)
ROG certa 2’s (in ear headphones but wouldn’t call them IEM’s) (4.5/10)",5
"brand new from the box, had an issue where the headphones would cut out randomly from time to time, takes about 10 seconds for it to turn back on. not the biggest problem but can definitely be annoying at times",4
"This headset not only complements my ARGB/Aura SYNC light setup with its dynamic lighting but also delivers outstanding functionality, the logo light up and I was able to add it to my music beat light show with my pc, keyboard, mouse, speaker.

The microphone's ability to detect and isolate only your voice is a game-changer, eliminating the need to constantly mute and unmute during conversations. I tried to put the microphone right next to my speaker playing loud music and it isolated it and never activated since it had detected it was a song and not someone speaking. The feature of muting when the microphone is lifted is very convenient.

The comfort factor, combined with Dolby Audio 7.1 Surround Sound, enhances the overall gaming and audio experience.

In summary, the Corsair HS80 RGB USB headset offers a perfect blend of aesthetics, functionality, and comfort. If you're looking for a premium gaming headset with advanced features, this one is a top-notch choice. A well-deserved 5/5 for its outstanding performance and seamless integration especially at that price point!",5
"Right out of the box, the wired headset disconnects with any small movement of the wire. Waste of time and money.",1
The band is not resizable in any way and is therefore unusable.,1
I paid 250$ for this headset only for the earpad to fall off in less than 3 months of use.,2
"Had these for 4 months, got them from a Canada Computers.
Took really good care of them and after 2 months of wear, the cloth around the earmuffs started to come off. This is how they look now after 4 months.
Give these ones a pass. Corsair seems to be making their products with weaker materials and construction these days.

Good black Friday deal,5
I bought at last year. It works well. The sound is good. but the recharge is slow but ok.,4
"Great headphone, good range but not the comfiest",3
"edit; originally gave this a 2 star review but after the first month I'm downgrading it to a 1 star review. This headset is terrible.

I upgraded to these $200~ headphones from my Corsair Void wireless headset which cost around $120, so that's my context.

I'm going to start off with what's noticeably worse.

The battery life isn't as long, probably by a decent margin like 20 - 25% although it's hard to be exact about this.

Range is about 25 - 40% shorter as well. I don't live in a large house and if I go from my bedroom to my kitchen it cuts out. We're talking maybe 25ft away at best through a single uninsulated wall. I used to be able to walk through my kitchen, out into the hallway to my front door, and even stand outside my front door.

Comfort is lacking. This is maybe a me problem. I have a big head. I've seen reviews saying these things are extremely light. They're light, but they squeeze. To the point that they genuinely hurt my ears after an hour or two and I find myself having to readjust them regularly. They seem to want to hug my ears. I can then move them so my ear is in the direct center and not being squeeze, but the headset slowly shifts. What bothers me though is the system this uses doesn't give a lot in the way of adjusting it. The existing headset and every other headset I've ever owned has a simple adjustment option. This has some velcro nonsense that doesn't really change much and doesn't impact the squeezing factor. I've had several headsets over the years and this is the first one that has been genuinely uncomfortable. I really dislike the velcro system as well. It just feels... bad.

Oh and when it's charging, and trust me, it'll be charging often-- there's a light on the microphone. So normally the microphone lights up red if it's muted. By default it lights red when you raise it because that's the auto-mute kicking in, and then if you manually mute it while it's down it will light up red. However when it's charging, it's just a bright white light, for no reason whatsoever. So *when* you end up needing to charge this while you're playing you have an annoying light in your peripheral vision at all times. I don't see any option to disable it. Probably going to try and tape over it. This is actually a really big issue for me. Mostly because of how extremely unnecessary it is. There's ZERO reason to have it. There's ZERO reason to not be able to disable it. Now if this thing had half decent battery life or charged faster that wouldn't matter, but it matters. It takes quite awhile to charge, so there's a glaring white light screwing with your vision. And again, I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO DO THIS. It wasn't a thing on their previous headsets. I can't imagine anyone, anywhere, for any reason enjoying having a bright white light THREE INCHES away from their eyeball.

Anyways sure, the mic is better quality and the overall sound quality is better-- but the audio still isn't that great, not $200 great anyways. Add in all the serious and significant downgrades and this is worse than the Void in my opinion. No idea how it received so many positive reviews.",1
"These are still working great after a year wanted to wait for a review have had no problems with anything they have a far range I can walk around the house and still communicate no problem, last long enough for me to charge it every 3 days or so with gaming sessions would recommend for a wireless headset if you are looking for one and mic quality is one of the best, for better battery life turn off the rgb makes a huge difference",5
"Do yourself a favor, never buy this product. Its bad from the hardware itself to the program that supports it. To begin, the head strap is useless. I don't have the biggest head in the world and it's extended to the maximum and still, the top of my head hurts even after several months. That's not he end of the world but the product itself just doesn't function properly. The program that supports it iCUE is horrible. I'm ALWAYS updating it in the hope that all the screeching problems, *cripiting* sounds and so on will be corrected one patch after the other. So far, nothing has changed. Since I have this headset, every time I want to stream my screen, somethings goes wrong with he sound like no sound in the game, I have to restart everything or, my mic doesn't work anymore. You think yeah, it's probably the game I'm streaming right ? Nope, i does the same thing with every other game I try it on. A friend of mine did not have a great opinion before I bough this one. Well, sadly, he was right. Do yourself a favor and skip on this one.",1
